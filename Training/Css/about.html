    <p>
        The thermal properties of water and its ability to release body heat when sweat evaporates
         from the skinâ€™s surface are of great help in maintaining body temperature throughout the day.
          A well-regulated body temperature will make us feel more energetic and keep our muscles and joints lubricated,
           preventing us from having cramps and sprains.
