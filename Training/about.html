        It’s an essential element to keep the body healthy because it cleans the body and eliminates toxins. 
       It is also an effective vehicle for transporting the vitamins and mineral salts that our cells need.

    <p class="error"> Water is used by the body to remove toxins and waste products.
         When there is less water in the body, the heart has to work harder to pump the oxygenated blood to all the cells and other major organs, 
         and that can cause fatigue.
         In most cases,
         the main reason for headaches and migraines is dehydration.

        When we drink enough water, the metabolism rate increases, that is, the food we eat breaks down properly. 
         This helps the digestive system to function properly and to prevent constipation.
